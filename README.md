# Custom Language Arithmetic Model

> ⚠️ **Note**: This project is currently in early development. Features and implementations may change significantly.

## Overview

This project explores the effectiveness of different language representations for mathematical operations using neural networks. It implements and compares two approaches:
- A custom symbolic language using mathematical symbols (⊕, ⊖, ⊗, etc.)
- Natural language descriptions of mathematical operations

## Features

Current implementation includes:

- 🧮 Complex arithmetic operations
- 🔄 Memory operations (store/recall)
- 🔀 Conditional logic
- 📐 Geometric operations
- 🔢 Set operations
- ⏱️ Temporal logic
- 🎯 Enhanced transformer-based model
- 🔍 Comparison capabilities

## Technical Details

- Built with PyTorch
- Uses transformer architecture
- Supports both custom symbolic and natural language processing
- Includes noise injection for robust training
- Implements dynamic batch processing

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- (Full requirements file coming soon)

## Current Status

The project is in active development with:

- [x] Basic arithmetic operations
- [x] Custom symbolic language
- [x] Natural language processing
