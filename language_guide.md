Think of it as a symbolic language for building expressions that deal with arithmetic, sets, temporal logic, and spatial geometry. I’ll break it down into a few parts: characters, basic expression structure, operations, memory usage, and sample expressions.

First, the language uses a custom set of characters, including digits, arrows, brackets, and a series of special symbols that represent operations. Numbers look like normal digits. Operations are often enclosed by parentheses or brackets.

Numbers, like 42, are just numeric values. Sets are shown as something like [3,5,10]. Points might look like [12.3, -4.5]. Temporal values might look like (1.20) or (0.50), indicating a boolean value and a timestamp.

To combine these elements, you use certain symbols. For arithmetic:
⊕ means plus
⊖ means minus
⊗ means multiplied by
⊘ means divided by
⊙ means modulo
⊚ means exponentiation

So something like (3⊕5) means 3 plus 5.

For sets:
∈ means “is in”
∉ means “is not in”
∪ means union
∩ means intersection
⊆ means “subset of”
≡ means “equivalent to”

For temporal logic:
◇ means “eventually”
□ means “always”
⊲ means “before”
⊳ means “after”
↣ means “leads to”

For spatial relations:
⊥ means perpendicular
∥ means parallel
δ means distance
θ means angle

Memory and conditional logic are handled with special constructs:
S0(…) might mean store a value in memory slot 0.
R0 means recall a value from memory slot 0.
?:(…) is a ternary expression that picks a result based on a condition.

A simple arithmetic expression:
(3⊕(4⊘2)) means 3 plus (4 divided by 2).

A set membership expression:
5∈[2,5,7] means “5 is in the set [2,5,7].”

A temporal expression:
◇3 could represent “(1.10) eventually within 3 time units.”

To read these expressions, think of the parentheses and brackets as normal grouping. The language builds questions like “(3⊕5)→4?” which asks, “Is (3 plus 5) greater than 4?” Here, “→” sets up a comparison against a value, and the question mark indicates a query.

Overall, the custom language is symbolic and compact. Each symbol has a meaning. Parentheses group sub-expressions. Sets and lists are shown in brackets. Operations are represented by symbolic operators. By reading each symbol carefully, you parse out arithmetic, set operations, logic checks, and spatial or temporal comparisons.
