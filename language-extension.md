## Proposed Language Extensions

### 1. Categorical Logic Extensions
```
Core Operators:
∈ : membership
∉ : non-membership
∪ : union
∩ : intersection
⊆ : subset
≡ : equivalence
∀ : universal quantifier
∃ : existential quantifier

Example Expression:
∀x∈A(∃y∈B(R(x,y))) -> [A⊆dom(R)]
```

### 2. Temporal Logic Components
```
Operators:
◇ : eventually
□ : always
↣ : leads-to
⊲ : before
⊳ : after
⊕ : next
⊖ : previous
⊗ : during

Temporal Relations:
t₁⊲t₂ : t₁ before t₂
[t₁,t₂]⊗E : Event E during interval
◇[t₁,t₂]P : P true sometime in interval
```

### 3. Spatial Relationship Tokens
```
Position Operators:
⊥ : perpendicular
∥ : parallel
⊙ : centered at
⊕ : adjacent to
⊗ : overlaps
⊘ : contains
⊚ : surrounds

Spatial Metrics:
δ : distance
θ : angle
∂ : boundary
```

### 4. Integration Example
```
Combined Expression Example:
∀x∈Region(◇[t₁,t₂](x⊗Target) ∧ δ(x,Base)≤r) → Alert

Natural Language:
"If any point in the Region overlaps with Target during time interval [t₁,t₂] 
and is within distance r of Base, trigger Alert"

Custom Language:
[∀x:R](◇[t₁,t₂](x⊗T)∧δ(x,B)≤r)→A
```
